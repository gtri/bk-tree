BK-tree
=======

A Java [BK-tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK-tree) library.

BK-trees offer a simple index of elements in a [metric space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space) that allows for searching the tree for elements within a certain distance of the search query with sub-linear efficiency.

For example, a BK-tree with string elements and a metric like the [Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance) can serve as a [fuzzy search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) index.
