/**
 * {@linkplain edu.gatech.gtri.bktree.BkTree BK-trees} offer a simple index of
 * elements in a {@linkplain edu.gatech.gtri.bktree.Metric metric space} that
 * allows for {@linkplain edu.gatech.gtri.bktree.BkTreeSearcher searching} the
 * tree for elements within a certain {@linkplain Metric distance} of the
 * search query with sub-linear efficiency.
 *
 * <p>For example, a BK-tree with {@link String} elements and a metric like the
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance">Damerauâ€“Levenshtein
 * distance</a> can serve as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching">fuzzy
 * search</a> index.
